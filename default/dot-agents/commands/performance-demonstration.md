# performance-demonstration

Make a script (in /\_research/performance) or other suitable folder that demonstrates the performance and correctnes of the code. Use Test to test equal outputs of current implementation. Use BenchmarkTools to benchmark performance.

In the script, use sections (##) to section the script into different parts as appropriate, notebook-style.

Use @benchmark and @info to print out what implementation is benchmarked.
