# Log Summary

Create concise but useful Obsidian notes summarizing conversations. Notes are stored in `~/Documents/AwesomeVault/Agent-summaries/`.

## File Creation

1. Create a new markdown file in `~/Documents/AwesomeVault/Agent-summaries/`
2. Use kebab-case filename based on the main topic (e.g., `fixing-hyprland-crash.md`)
3. Include YAML frontmatter with metadata
4. Write concise but useful content based on conversation type

## Note Template

# Fixing Docker Permission Denied Error

## Summary

User couldn't run docker commands without sudo. Fixed by adding user to docker group.

## Details

**Problem:** Permission denied when running `docker ps`

**Root Cause:** User not in `docker` group

**Solution:**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
````

**Verification:** Ran `docker ps` successfully without sudo

## Key Takeaways

- Docker group membership required for non-root usage
- `newgrp` applies changes without logout/login
- Also works: restart session or reboot
